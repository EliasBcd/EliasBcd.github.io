**DISCLAIMER: This is an example of what the results will look like.**

You can find here the results from Experiment 2 carried on by Renaud Foucart and Elias Bouacida. 

The different draws of the DC-Lottery of August XX at 12.50pm are:

<!-- - DC-2:  X, X, so the participant number selected is XX; -->
<!-- - DC-3: X, X, X, the rest in the division by 200 is `r dc3 %% 200`, which is the threshold amount (in cents). -->
<!-- - DC-4: X, X, X, X, so the rest in the division by 3 is `r dc4%%3` and the question for predictions selected is XX. -->
<!-- - DC-5: X, X, X, X, X, so the sequence to match is X, X, X, X, X. -->

The selected mechanism for the allocation of the reward is XX.
