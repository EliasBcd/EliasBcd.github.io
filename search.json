    "title": "Identifying Choice Correspondences",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We introduce a general method for identifying the sets of best alternatives of decision makers in each choice sets, i.e., their choice correspondences, experimentally. In contrast, most experiments force the choice of a single alternative in each choice set. The method allow decision makers to choose several alternatives, provide a small incentive for each alternative chosen, and then randomly select one for payment. We derive two conditions under which the method may recover the choice correspondence. First, when the incentive to choose several alternative becomes small. Second, we can at least partially identifies the choice correspondence, by obtaining supersets and subsets for each choice set. We illustrate the method with an experiment, in which subjects choose between four paid tasks. In the latter case, we can retrieve the full choice correspondence for 18% of subjects and bind it for another 40%. Using the limit result, we show that 40% of all observed choices can be rationalized by complete, reflexive and transitive preferences in the experiment, i.e., satisfy the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences – WARP hereafter. Weakening the classical model, incomplete preferences or just-noticeable difference preferences do not rationalize more choice correspondences. Going beyond, however, we show that complete, reflexive and transitive preferences with menu-dependent choices rationalize 96% of observed choices. Having elicited choice correspondences allows to conclude that indifference is widespread in the experiment.These results pave the way for exploring various behavioral models with a unified method."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We consider the problem of allocating a scarce resource to individuals. A centralized market procedure eliciting individual valuations and yielding a unique price provides in theory the most efficient and equitable way of doing so. As compared to an individualized procedure where the price can possibly differ among players, we show experimentally how such a market indeed protects subjects who make mistakes. We however find little support for a centralized market procedure. One reason is that the benefits from the market are concentrated on a minority of subjects, and many vote against their own monetary interest. The other is that subjects who can expect similar payoffs in both procedures show a strong preference against the market."

The size of the set of priors, as well as the subjective measure of ambiguity, have no impact on the randomization behavior of our participants.

    "text": "Abstract\nWe study the impact of external advice on the relative performance of chess players. We asked players in chess tournaments to evaluate positions in past games and allowed them to revise their evaluation following advice from a high or a low ability player. While high-quality advice has the potential to act as a “great equalizer,” reducing the difference between high and low ability players, this is not what happens in our experiment. This is in part because our subjects ignore too much of the advice they receive. It is also because low ability players pay a higher premium than high ability ones by following their initial idea instead of high-quality advice."
