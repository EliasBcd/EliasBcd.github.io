    "text": "This paper explores the relationship between deliberate randomization and non-expected utility behavior in decision-making under ambiguity. Using an experimental approach, we investigate individual preferences in ambiguous environments, where hedging against ambiguity is considered optimal according to some theoretical models. We alter ambiguity from two different angles by varying its subjective (the degree of ambiguity associated with beliefs) and objective (the size of the probability space) extent. The size of the set of priors, as well as the subjective measure of ambiguity, have no impact on the randomization behavior of our participants. Interestingly, participants’ randomization decisions are not influenced by the change in the relationship between ambiguous alternatives, suggesting the presence of correlation neglect. Further, our design separates ambiguity attitudes from ambiguity insensitivity. The regression analysis reveals that ambiguity aversion has a significant effect on the choice to randomize, indicating that individuals with higher levels of ambiguity aversion are more likely to choose a mixed act over a pure act."

    "text": "We introduce a general method for identifying the sets of best alternatives of decision makers in each choice sets, i.e., their choice correspondences, experimentally. In contrast, most experiments force the choice of a single alternative in each choice set. The method allow decision makers to choose several alternatives, provide a small incentive for each alternative chosen, and then randomly select one for payment. We derive two conditions under which the method may recover the choice correspondence. First, when the incentive to choose several alternative becomes small. Second, we can at least partially identifies the choice correspondence, by obtaining supersets and subsets for each choice set. We illustrate the method with an experiment, in which subjects choose between four paid tasks. In the latter case, we can retrieve the full choice correspondence for 18% of subjects and bind it for another 40%. Using the limit result, we show that 40% of all observed choices can be rationalized by complete, reflexive and transitive preferences in the experiment, i.e., satisfy the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences – WARP hereafter. Weakening the classical model, incomplete preferences or just-noticeable difference preferences do not rationalize more choice correspondences. Going beyond, however, we show that complete, reflexive and transitive preferences with menu-dependent choices rationalize 96% of observed choices. Having elicited choice correspondences allows to conclude that indifference is widespread in the experiment.These results pave the way for exploring various behavioral models with a unified method."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We study the efficiency, equity, and social acceptability of market procedures in the allocation of Locally Undesirable Land Uses (LULU) such as polluting industries or waste treatment facilities. As most LULU are allocated using individualized negotiations, it can mean deprived communities ending up being allocated more for a lower compensation. In theory, a centralized market offering the same compensation to everyone allocated a LULU should be efficient and envy-free, solving one of the major concerns of the environmental justice movement. We show experimentally how a centralized market indeed protects those who understand the least. We however find little support for this procedure. One reason is that the benefits from the market are concentrated on a minority of subjects, and many vote against their own monetary interest. The other is that subjects who can expect similar payoffs in both procedures show a strong preference against the market."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We study the efficiency, equity, and social acceptability of market procedures in the allocation of Locally Undesirable Land Uses (LULU) such as polluting industries or waste treatment facilities. As most LULU are allocated using individualized negotiations, it can mean deprived communities ending up being allocated more for a lower compensation. In theory, a centralized market offering the same compensation to everyone allocated a LULU should be efficient and envy-free, solving one of the major concerns of the environmental justice movement. We show experimentally how a centralized market indeed protects those who understand the least. We however find little support for this procedure. One reason is that the benefits from the market are concentrated on a minority of subjects, and many vote against their own monetary interest. The other is that subjects who can expect similar payoffs in both procedures show a strong preference against the market."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When choices are inconsistent due to behavioral biases, there is a theoretical debate about whether the structure of a model is necessary for providing precise welfare guidance based on those choices. To address this question empirically, we use standard data sets from the lab and field to evaluate the predictive power of two “model-free” approaches to behavioral welfare analysis. We find they typically have high predictive power, which means there is little ambiguity about what should be selected from each choice set. We also identify properties of revealed preferences that help to explain the predictive power of these approaches."
