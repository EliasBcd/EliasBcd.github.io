Remember that 1 point in the experiment is $0.02.\nThe procedure selected by most participants in the experiment is PROCEDURE XX. The draws of the DC-3 lottery of XX were 2, 8, 3, the variable amount received for participants are:\n\n80 points for a TYPE A participant in the GREEN GROUP;\n20 points for a TYPE A participant in the BLUE GROUP;\n80 points for a TYPE B participant in the GREEN GROUP;\n20 points for a TYPE B participant in the BLUE GROUP.\n\nThe DC-2 lottery of XX were 3, 0, so the question selected is the third one. Those who chose the sure amount will receive 9 points, the others 0 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAbout You\nPayments\nProcedures\nProcedure Payments\nExpectations\n\n\n  \n    Code \n    Type \n
