## Biography

I am a Ph.D. in economics. I am a decision theorist and experimental economist working on the modeling and the understanding of human behavior. I design experiments and use revealed preference techniques to study various assumptions on individual preferences and utility. I have also started using experiment to understand what procedures people prefer in the allocation of public goods.

I am currently working as maître de conférence (assistant professor) in the [Laboratoire d'économie dyonisien](https://sites.google.com/site/up8led/home) at the [University Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/en/).

## Research Interests

I have two main research interests, which both are linked by the understanding of human behavior.
First, I am interested in **testing theories of behavior**, which requires both understanding the theory and then implementing tests of the theories, usually through laboratory experiment.
Second, I am interested in the **social acceptability** of scientific, and in particular, economists' solutions to modern societal problems, like climate change.

You can have a look at all my past and current research [here](research/).

## Teaching

I teach various courses at University Paris 8, mainly in microeconomics, at different levels. 
I also supervise undergraduate projects and master thesis.
