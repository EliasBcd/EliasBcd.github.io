I am a Ph.D. in economics. I am a decision theorist and experimental economist working on the modeling and the understanding of human behavior. I design experiments and use revealed preference techniques to study various assumptions on individual preferences and utility. I have also started using experiment to understand what procedures people prefer in the allocation of public goods.

I am currently working as maître de conférence (assistant professor) in the [Laboratoire d'économie dyonisien](https://sites.google.com/site/up8led/home) at the [University Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/en/).
